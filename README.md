# MAMAJ Furniture Showroom

A mobile-first digital showroom for MAMAJ (Fabrika e Mobileve) — browse handcrafted
furniture by room, view collections, and contact the showroom. This is a **catalog,
not a store**: there is no cart, checkout, or pricing anywhere in the app, by design.

The whole site — every photo, product, category/room page, and piece of copy — is
editable by the business owner through a private admin dashboard, with no code
changes or developer involvement needed for day-to-day updates.

## What's here

- **Public site** — Home, Categories, individual room pages (Living Room, Bedroom,
  Kitchen, Dining Room, Home Office, Outdoor, and any rooms you add later), Gallery,
  About, Contact. Mobile-first design, responsive from a 320px phone up through
  desktop (where it renders as a framed device on a dark backdrop rather than
  stretching full-width).
- **Admin CMS** at `/admin` — a hidden dashboard (not linked anywhere on the public
  site) where the owner logs in to edit hero text, categories/products, photos,
  gallery, About Us content, and contact/site info. Changes go live immediately.
- **API + database** — a small Express server backed by SQLite, with JWT-cookie admin
  auth and local image uploads.

Design system: deep navy (`#16222F`) + gold (`#EBC84C`) on a warm cream background,
Cormorant Garamond for headings, Inter for body text, Poppins for the wordmark.

## Quick start

Requires Node 18+.

```bash
npm install                       # installs root, server, and client (npm workspaces)
cp server/.env.example server/.env
npm run seed                      # creates the SQLite DB with starter content
npm run dev                       # runs the API (:3001) and the site (:5173) together
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** for the public site.

Running the two halves separately, if you ever need to:

```bash
npm run dev -w server   # API only, http://localhost:3001
npm run dev -w client   # Vite dev server only, http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api and /uploads to :3001)
```

## The admin CMS

**This is the important part.** The admin dashboard is not linked from anywhere on the
public site — no button, no footer link, nothing a visitor can stumble onto. You get to
it by going directly to:

```
http://localhost:5173/admin/login
```

(Once deployed, it's just `https://your-domain.com/admin/login`.)

Log in with the credentials from `server/.env` (see [Environment
variables](#environment-variables)). From the dashboard you can, without touching any
code:

| Tab | What you can do |
|---|---|
| **Home Page** | Edit the hero eyebrow/headline/CTA + hero photo, the workshop quote band, and the contact section heading/intro. |
| **Categories & Products** | Add a whole new room/subpage (e.g. "Garden") — it instantly becomes a real page at `/rooms/garden` with its own hero and product grid, the same way Kitchen or Bedroom work today. Edit or delete existing categories. Expand any category's "Manage Products" to add/edit/remove products: name, material, photo, an optional NEW/CUSTOM badge, and a toggle to feature it in the Home page's "New Designs" carousel. |
| **Gallery** | Add/remove photos and captions for the masonry gallery page. |
| **About Us** | Edit the story paragraphs, the "What We Value" list, the hero photo, and the closing quote. |
| **Site Settings** | Phone, WhatsApp, email, address, Facebook/Instagram, business hours, and the logo — these feed the footer and Contact page everywhere. |

Every photo field is a click-to-upload control (PNG/JPEG/WebP, resized and stored under
`server/uploads/`). Every change is saved via the API and appears on the live site
immediately — there's no publish/rebuild step.

### Default admin credentials

Set in `server/.env` (copied from `server/.env.example`, which is safe to commit —
`server/.env` itself is gitignored so real credentials never get committed):

```
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-this-password
JWT_SECRET=change-this-to-a-long-random-string
```

**Change `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `JWT_SECRET` before relying on this for real**, then run
`npm run seed` once — seeding is idempotent, so it only creates the admin account and
starter content that don't already exist; it won't touch or duplicate content you've
already added.

## How it fits together

- **Categories are pages.** Each row in the `categories` table renders at
  `/rooms/:slug` via one shared `RoomPage` component. Adding a category in the admin
  *is* adding a new page — there's no separate "create a page" step.
- **Products belong to a category** and can optionally be flagged `featured_home`,
  which is what populates the Home page's "New Designs" carousel — no separate content
  model for that carousel.
- **Auth** is a signed JWT in an httpOnly cookie (`mamaj_admin`), checked by a
  `requireAdmin` middleware on every mutating route. Public `GET` routes need no auth.
- **Images** are uploaded via `multer` to `server/uploads/`, served statically at
  `/uploads/...`, and only their URL is stored in SQLite — so back up
  `server/data.sqlite` *and* `server/uploads/` together if you ever move hosts.
- **No photos ship by default.** Every image slot renders a soft branded placeholder
  until the admin uploads something — this was a deliberate choice so nothing looks
  like a stock photo that isn't actually MAMAJ's work.

## Environment variables

`server/.env` (see `server/.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | API server port (default `3001`) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Signing secret for admin session cookies — must be a long random string in production |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Used only by `npm run seed` to create the first admin account |
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | Allowed CORS origin for the API (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`) — set this to your real domain in production |
| `NODE_ENV` | Set to `production` to mark the admin cookie `secure` (HTTPS-only) |

## Deploying

This is a standard two-process Node app — there's no framework lock-in:

1. Build the client: `npm run build -w client` → static files in `client/dist/`.
2. Serve `client/dist/` from any static host or CDN, **or** have the Express server
   serve it directly (not wired up yet — ask if you want this added so it's a single
   deployable process).
3. Run the API (`node server/src/index.js`) somewhere that keeps `server/data.sqlite`
   and `server/uploads/` on persistent disk (a container with a mounted volume, or a
   small VM — SQLite is file-based, so it doesn't want ephemeral/serverless storage).
4. Point the client's `/api` and `/uploads` requests at wherever the API actually runs
   (via a reverse proxy, or by setting the API's `CLIENT_ORIGIN` and adjusting the
   client's fetch base URL if they're not served from the same origin).
5. Set real values for `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Known limitations / next steps

- The contact forms (Home page + Contact page) are currently **presentational** —
  submitting shows a thank-you message but doesn't send an email/SMS/notification
  anywhere yet. Say the word if you want this wired up.
- SQLite is great for a single-server deployment but isn't a fit if you ever need
  multiple app servers writing concurrently — not a concern at this scale, just noting
  it for the future.
- There's no "forgot password" flow for the admin account — if you lose the password,
  reset it by editing `server/.env` and re-running `npm run seed` after clearing the
  `admin_users` table (or ask and I can add a proper reset flow).
